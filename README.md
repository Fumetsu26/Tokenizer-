# 📝 TOKENIZER

I have created a **tokenizer** using **raw JavaScript** for the core logic.  
The tokenizer provides **two main functions**:

1. **Encode** – Converts an input prompt into tokens.  
2. **Decode** – Converts tokens back into the original prompt.

### 📌 Terminal Output Example
Here’s a snippet of the terminal showing the desired outputs from the core logic:

### 💻 User Interface
To make the tokenizer more user-friendly, I implemented a **React-based UI** that uses the same JavaScript logic from `tokenizer.js`.  
This allows users to interact with the tokenizer directly in their browser.

### 🚀 Live Demo
You can try the tokenizer online here:

💡 *The core tokenizer logic remains framework-independent, making it reusable in both browser-based and Node.js environments.*
